# `.uccignore` file

This feature can be used to remove files from the output **after** UCC template files were copied and **before** the source of the 
add-on recursively overrides the output folder.

It is expected to be placed in the same folder as `globalConfig` file to have effect.

You will see a warning message in case ignored file is not found in the output folder.
