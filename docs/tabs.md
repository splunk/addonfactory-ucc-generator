# Tabs

UCC currently supports 2 different types of tabs: "Configuration" and "Inputs".
"Search" tab is included by default.

## Configuration

"Configuration" tab can have multiple different subtabs, for example, a tab
for account configuration (name and API key), proxy configuration and logging 
level configuration.

## Inputs

Holds input configuration information for data collection. 
If we have a variety of input configurations, we can create more than one input service under the input page.
