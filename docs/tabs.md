# Tabs

UCC currently supports 2 different types of tabs: "Configuration" and "Inputs".
"Search" tab is included by default.

## Configuration

"Configuration" tab can have multiple different subtabs, for example, a tab
for account configuration (name and API key), proxy configuration and logging 
level configuration.

## Inputs

"Inputs" tab can have multiple type of inputs as well, for example, for 2 
completely different APIs that require different parameters.
