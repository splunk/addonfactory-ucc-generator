title: Alert Actions
---

The alert action can help a user to take action on the alerts that have been triggered. The knowledge from Splunk can be sent to an outside service or to pull additional or detailed information related to the trigger details.
An add-on can have multiple alert actions based on the use cases the add-on provides. You can know more about alert actions from [this documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Alert/Aboutalerts).

Developers are required to add alerts in the global config file to create an Alert Action. All the alerts
(belonging to all the add-ons and apps) present on a Splunk instance would be shown in the "Trigger Actions" section when creating an alert.
