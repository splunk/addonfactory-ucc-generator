UCC allows you to add Auth support in the configuration page. In UCC, OAuth2.0 of the Authorization Code Flow `grant` type is being used. It only supports the standard parameters specified in [RFCP749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749) for obtaining an authorization code.

Auth can be used inside the entity tag. Use `type: "oauth"` in the entity list and also need to specify the `options` next to the `type: "oauth"`.

### Properties

- `type` field value must be oauth.
- `options`:
    - `auth_type` must be present. It can have either ["basic", "oauth"] (If we want basic and oauth both support) or ["oauth"] (If we want oauth support only).
    - `basic` This must be present only if auth_type: ["basic"]
        - This will have list of fields you want to add in basic authentication flow. In the given example, it is username, password and security_token. 
        - **Please note that as of now, If you are selecting basic as auth_type then username and password fields are mandatory.**
    - `oauth` This will have list of fields you want to add in oauth authentication flow. In the given example, it is `client_id`, `client_secret`, `redirect_url`, `scope` and `endpoint`.
    - These fields are mandatory:
        - `client_id` this is client id for the your app for which you want auth
        - `client_secret` this is client secret for the your app for which you want auth
        - `redirect_url` this will show redirect url which needs to be put in app's redirect url.
        - `endpoint` this will be endpoint for which we want to build oauth support. For example for salesforce that will be either "login.salesforce.com" or "test.salesforce.com" or any other custom endpoint.
    - `auth_code_endpoint` this must be present and its value should be endpoint value for getting the auth_code using the app. If the url to get auth_code is https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize then this will have value /services/oauth2/authorize
    - `access_token_endpoint` this must be present and its value should be endpoint value for getting access_token using the auth_code received. If the url to get access token is https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token then this will have value /services/oauth2/token
    - `auth_label` this allow user to have custom label for Auth Type dropdown
    - `oauth_popup_width` width in pixels of the popup window that will open for oauth authentication (Optional, defaults to 600)
    - `oauth_popup_height` height in pixels of the popup window that will open for oauth authentication (Optional, defaults to 600)
    - `oauth_timeout` timeout in seconds for oauth authentication (Optional, defaults to 180 seconds)
    - `oauth_state_enabled` to include state for oauth authentication (default value is false)

    - Fields allowed in basic and oauth fields as of now:
        - `oauth_field`: This should be kept as it is and without any change.
        - `label`: This can be changed if the user wants to change the label of the field in UI.
        - `field`: For now this user must keep it as it is for mandatory fields as mentioned above.
        - `help` : This can be changed if user wants to change the help text displayed below field.
        - `encrypted` : This should be true if user wants that particular field encrypted else no need to have this parameter.
        - `placeholder`: The placeholder for the field.
        - `required`: To specify whether the field is required or not. The default value is true.
