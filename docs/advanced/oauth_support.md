UCC allows you to add Auth support in the configuration page. In UCC, OAuth2.0 of the Authorization Code Flow `grant` type is used. It only supports the standard parameters specified in [RFCP749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749) for obtaining an authorization code.

Auth can be used inside the entity tag. Use `type: "oauth"` in the entity list and specify the `options` next to the `type: "oauth"`.

### Properties

- `type` field value must be oauth.
- `options`:
    + `auth_type` must be present. It can have either ["basic", "oauth"] (If we want basic and oauth both support) or ["oauth"] (If we want oauth support only).
    + `basic` must be present only if the auth_type is ["basic"].
        - This will have a list of fields for you to add in the basic authentication flow. In the given example, it is username, password, and security_token.
        - **Note: As of now, if you are selecting basic as auth_type, then the username and password fields are mandatory.**
    + `oauth` will have a list of fields for you to add in the oauth authentication flow. In the given example, it is `client_id`, `client_secret`, `redirect_url`, `scope`, and `endpoint`.
    + These fields are mandatory:
        - `client_id` is the client id for applying auth to your app or apps.
        - `client_secret` is the client secret for applying auth to your app or apps.
        - `redirect_url` will show the redirect url, which needs to be put in the app's redirect url.
        - `endpoint` will be the endpoint for you to build oauth support. For example, for salesforce, it will either  be "login.salesforce.com", "test.salesforce.com", or any other custom endpoint.
            + There is also the ability to specify separate endpoints for authorize and token. To do this, instead of the single 'endpoint' field, use two separate ones:
                - `endpoint_authorize` specifies the endpoint used for authorization, for example, login.salesforce.com.
                - `endpoint_token` specifies the endpoint used for the token acqusition, for example, api.login.salesforce.com.
    + `auth_code_endpoint` must be present and its value should be the endpoint value for getting the auth_code using the app. If the url to get the auth_code is https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize, then this will have the value /services/oauth2/authorize.
    + `access_token_endpoint` must be present and its value should be the endpoint value for getting the ccess_token using the auth_code received. If the url to get the access token is https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token, then it will have the value /services/oauth2/token.
    + `auth_label` allows the user to have the custom label for the Auth Type dropdown.
    + `oauth_popup_width` is the width in pixels of the pop-up window that will open for oauth authentication (Optional, defaults to 600).
    + `oauth_popup_height` is the height in pixels of the pop-up window that will open for oauth authentication (Optional, defaults to 600).
    + `oauth_timeout` is the timeout in seconds for oauth authentication (Optional, defaults to 180 seconds).
    + `oauth_state_enabled` is used to include the state for oauth authentication (default value is false).
    + `auth_endpoint_token_access_type` is an optional parameter that is mapped into the value of the token_access_type query param in the authorisation url.

    + The fields allowed in the basic and oauth fields are the following:
        - `oauth_field` should be kept as it is and without any change.
        - `label` can be changed if the user wants to change the label of the field in UI.
        - `field` must keep it as it is for mandatory fields as mentioned before.
        - `help` can be changed the if user wants to change the help text displayed below the field.
        - `encrypted` should be true if the user wants that particular field encrypted, otherwise, there is no need to have this parameter.
        - `required` specifies whether the field is required or not. The default value is true.
        - `defaultValue` is the initial input value (string, number, or boolean).
        - `options`:
            + `placeholder`: (RENOUNCED) The placeholder for the field.
            + `disableonEdit`: When the form is in edit mode, the field becomes unable to be edited. The default value is false.
            + `enable`: The enable property sets whether a field is enabled or not. The default value is true.
