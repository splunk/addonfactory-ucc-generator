  "readme": "underscore-contrib\n==================\n\nThe brass buckles on Underscore's utility belt -- a contributors' library for [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/).\n\nLinks\n-----\n\n  * [Documentation](http://documentcloud.github.io/underscore-contrib/)\n  * [Source repository](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore-contrib)\n  * [Tickets and bug reports](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore-contrib/issues?state=open)\n  * [Maintainer's website](http://www.fogus.me)\n\nWhy underscore-contrib?\n-----------------------\n\nWhile Underscore provides a bevy of useful tools to support functional programming in JavaScript, it can't\n(and shouldn't) be everything to everyone. Underscore-contrib is intended as a home for functions that, for\nvarious reasons, don't belong in Underscore proper. In particular, it aims to be:\n\n  * a home for functions that are limited in scope, but solve certain point problems, and\n  * a proving ground for features that belong in Underscore proper, but need some advocacy and/or evolution\n(or devolution) to get them there.\n\nUse\n---\n\nFirst, you’ll need Underscore. Then you can grab the relevant underscore-contrib libraries and simply add\nsomething\nlike the following to your pages:\n\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"underscore.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"underscore.object.builders.js\"></script>\n\nAt the moment there are no cross-contrib dependencies (i.e. each library can stand by itself), but that may\nchange in the future.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nThere is still a lot of work to do around perf, documentation, examples, testing and distribution so any help\nin those areas is welcomed. Pull requests are accepted, but please search the [issues](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore-contrib/issues)\nbefore proposing a new sub-contrib or addition. Additionally, all patches and proposals should have strong\ndocumentation, motivating cases and tests. It would be nice if we could not only provide useful tools built on\nUnderscore, but also provide an educational experience for why and how one might use them.\n\nOther (potentially) useful sub-contribs include the following:\n\n  * String utilities\n  * Date/time utilities\n  * Validators\n  * Iterators\n  * Generators\n  * Promises\n  * Monads\n  * Currying\n  * Laziness\n  * Multimethods\n\nWhat do these mean? Well, that’s up for discussion. :-)\n",
