This version has also been released for Intel Macs.

__Enhancements:__

* Add support for JScript's function extensions, such as `function window.onload() {}` and `function window::onload()`. (This is disabled by default.)

* Warn against trailing comments in array initializers.

* Warn against calls to `parseInt` without a radix parameter.
* Warn against implicit type conversion when comparing against `true` or `false`.
* Clarify the warning against `with` statements.

__Bug Fixes:__

* Fix syntax error on nested comments.
* Fix duplicate case warning.
* Fix insuppressible increment/decrement warning.
* Fix incorrect warning against invalid `/*jsl:fallthru*/` comment.
* Fix undeclared identifiers in `with` statements.
		
_Update:_ Corrected post title.
