## [JavaScript Lint 0.1j Released](__BASENAME__)
_Mon, 05 Dec 2005 20:19:35 +0000_

This release fixes a bug in the "duplicate case" warning for numbers. Certain numbers were incorrectly reported as duplicates.  (This bug is more likely to affect JavaScript programmers using big-endian processors.)

The [Online Lint](/online_lint.php) has also been updated to use a local CGI, making the script much more responsive. PHP source code for the Online Lint is included in the source package.

Available from the [download page](/download.htm).
