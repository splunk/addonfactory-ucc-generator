Developers can also check out from the Subversion trunk:

The [documentation](/docs/) explains the different ways that you can run JavaScript Lint.

JavaScript Lint continues to be improved. If you encounter problems or have suggestions or revisions, please visit the project [forum](http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=168518) and [tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=168518).

Acknowledgements
================

We all stand on the shoulders of giants. I would like to especially acknowledge [Douglas Crockford's](http://www.crockford.com/) work on [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/). This lint is itself written in JavaScript and is an interesting and rather sophisticated script. Crockford's ideas about good coding practices served as a springboard for many of these lint rules.

We are all indebted to the many people who have worked hard to develop Firefox.
