Running from Windows Explorer
=============================

The easiest way to run JavaScript lint is by adding it to the right-click menu on .htm and .js files. To do so, open Windows Explorer and choose Tools | Folder Options | File Types. Select the .js file type. Click Advanced, then click New. Enter these settings (paths will vary):

__Action__: Lint

__Application used to perform action__: `c:\path\to\jsl.exe -conf c:\path\to\configuration\file -process "%1" -pauseatend`

Repeat these steps for all the file types that you wish to lint (e.g. .htm, .hta, and .wsf).
